# MplusQapiClient

This is the official PHP client for the MplusKASSA SOAP API.

```
composer require mpluskassa/mplusqapi
```

## Usage

```php
use MplusKASSA\MplusQapi\MplusApiClient;

$client = new MplusApiClient('api.mpluskassa.nl', $port, $ident, $secret);

$response = $client->getApiVersion();

echo "{$response->serviceMajorNumber}.{$response->serviceMinorNumber}.{$response->serviceRevisionNumber}";
```

## Debugging

To retrieve the raw SOAP XML contents of the last request and/or response that were sent, use `getLastRequest`  and `getLastReponse`.

```php

// ...

$response = $client->getApiVersion();

$lastRequest = $client->getLastRequest();

echo $lastRequest;

$lastResponse = $client->getLastResponse();

echo $lastResponse;
```

## Features and Goals

- No runtime WSDL parsing needed.
- Strict typing.
- Increased productivity.

## Notes on how the WSDL is mapped to PHP

- xsd:Date and xsd:DateTime are mapped to \DateTime
- xsd:Decimal is mapped to Brick\BigDecimal
- SoapMplusData and SoapMplusDataTime are converted to \DateTime
- Many longs that contain an unscaled value and their companion decimalplaces are converted to Brick\BigDecimal
- When a list is wrapped in an object containing only that list one level of indirection is removed

## Dependencies

- guzzlehttp/guzzle
- brick/math
